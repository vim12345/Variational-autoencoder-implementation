# Variational-autoencoder-implementation
# Description:
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model used to generate new data similar to the training dataset. It is an extension of the autoencoder that introduces variational inference to learn the distribution of the data. VAEs are commonly used in image generation, anomaly detection, and unsupervised learning.

In this project, we’ll implement a VAE that learns a latent variable representation of the data and generates new samples from this learned distribution.

# ✅ What It Does:
* Defines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture with an encoder, decoder, and reparameterization trick for latent variable sampling

* Loss function combines reconstruction loss (BCE) and KL divergence for regularization, ensuring the learned distribution approximates a Gaussian distribution

* Trains on the MNIST dataset, learns a latent representation of the digits, and can generate new samples from the learned distribution
